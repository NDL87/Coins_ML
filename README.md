# Coins_ML
## Personal sandbox for mastering ML through investigating coins (numismatics)

**Play around plan includes the following ML tasks:**
1. **Classification** (the most exciting and attractive part) 
   - Epoch Classifier based on emperors portraits
   - Epoch Classifier based on coat of arms (the eagle) type
2. **Regression** (the most informative part with nearly infinite number of potential subtasks):
   - Correlation analysis (between main and non-obvious features)
   - Coin price predictor (based on selected features)
1. **Anomaly Detection** (least funny but potentially important):
   - Outliers detection (e.g. pricewise)
2. **Clustering** (might be insightful in various applications):
   -  Coin condition assignment (image-based)
